# Machine_Learning_Step_by_Step
This repository will contain tutorials or guides on start to finish data projects (academic kaggle competitions)

This will be my "Hello World" Repository to Machine Learning and Data Science. You can expect to find walk throughs on the academic kaggle competitions from classification, to unsupervised problems. This Repository will also go into depth on data visualization, how to code them, use them and interpret them.
